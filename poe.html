        <h2>Personal Note</h2>
        <p>The first quarter of 2023 marks a truly special time in every aspect of my life. After a while 
          in software development, I finally mustered up all of my courage to make the shift to UX design. 
          In every team that I have been so fortunate to be a part of, I realize I have always cared more 
          about interfaces and how to deliver a more inclusive, intuitive experience for users. I began to 
          incorporate UX principles into my project at work, strengthen my visual design skills by serving as 
          a Director of Design at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ubcbiztech/mycompany/" class="nav-link">
          UBC BizTech</a>, and most importantly work on a UX design certificate at BrainStation. 
          I started this project in that certificate program, where I was mentored by Paul Pittman, former Senior UX 
          Designer at Amazon. </p>
          <p><b>In this case study, I take you through my unsolicited UX 
            redesign of <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/06/quora-opens-its-new-ai-chatbot-app-poe-to-the-general-public/">Poe</a>, 
            Quora's ultimate AI chatbot app. </b></p>

            <h2>Poe, Where All the AI Bots Hang Out</h2>
        <p>Since OpenAI released its blockbuster AI bot, ChatGPT, in November 2022, it has quickly amassed 
          an impressive 100 million users within just two months of its release. The explosive popularity of 
          ChatGPT has ushered in a new era of <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/innovationendeavors/the-biggest-bottleneck-for-large-language-model-startups-is-ux-ef4500e4e786">how people directly interface with large language models (LLMs) 
          and generative AI</a>.</p>
          <p>Soon after, Quora jumped on the AI bot bandwagon with  <a target="_blank" href="https://quorablog.quora.com/Poe-1">Poe</a> (short for Platform of Open Exploration) — an AI chatbot mobile app that enables users to ask questions, 
            receive responses from multiple AI chatbots, and share their dialogues with the chatbots on a feed.
            </p>
            <p>The 2 defining features of Poe on mobile include: </p>
            
            <p><b>1. Switching between multiple AI chatbots:</b>
              Poe is now like a text messaging app but for AI models. The AI on Poe is currently powered by OpenAI and Anthropic, 
              ensuring that users get the best answers to their questions, since "<a target="_blank" href="https://quorablog.quora.com/Poe-1">different models will be optimized for different tasks, 
              they will represent different points of view, or they will have access to different knowledge</a>," said Quora’s CEO Adam D’Angelo.</p>
              
              <p><b>2. Reading from/ posting to a feed of other users’ conversations with AI chatbots:</b> The social aspect of the app 
              also enables users to read and post to a feed of other users’ dialogues with AI chatbots, facilitating the discovery
               of new and creative use cases of Poe: "<a target="_blank" href="https://quorablog.quora.com/Poe-1">The capabilities of these AI models are best discovered collectively, 
               with people teaching each other what is possible</a>."
             </p>
             <div class="landing-img">
              <img src="/Assets/poe-demo-1.png" alt="Avatar" class="demo-img reveal "/>
              <img src="/Assets/poe-demo-2.png" alt="Avatar" class="demo-img reveal hidden-mobile  "/>
              <img src="/Assets/poe-demo-4.png" alt="Avatar" class="demo-img reveal "/>
            </div>
            <h2>The UX of AI</h2>
        <p>
          Like many others, I began using Poe when it was made available for public access in early February 2023 on iOS, 
          and I ended up loving the product. I believe the team at Quora has created a true one-stop shop of all the AI bots, 
          making asking chatbots questions and exploring use cases of generative AI incredibly quick, useful, and fun. 
          However, as an enthusiastic user of Poe, I have found that the user experience can be a bit frustrating to navigate 
          at times. I believe that a UX redesign of Poe would be a positive step towards improving the user experience and 
          making the product more accessible to a wider range of users.</p>
          <p>This experience has pushed me to explore a more 
          specific domain in UX design: <a target="_blank" href="https://uxofai.com">Designing for AI/ ML</a>. A lot has been written 
          about <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/innovationendeavors/the-biggest-bottleneck-for-large-language-model-startups-is-ux-ef4500e4e786">
          UX design for LLM startups</a> — and I thought this is so interesting. To delve further into this domain, I started by watching a talk at Figma Config 2021 by Quora's Product Design Lead, 
          Lalo Martínez, "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CwZ_4eTDzc">When Design Meets Machine Learning</a>," where he 
          talked about four pillars of AI/ ML-enabled user experience: explicitness, frequency, specificity, and consistency. </p>

          <p>As a developer-turned-UX designer, I became intrigued with the AI/ML domain within product design and wanted 
          to explore it further. My aim is to <b>create a more immersive experience of Poe through an unsolicited UX redesign.</b></p>

          <h2>Research & Current Design Analysis</h2>
          <p><i>“Recognizing the need is the primary condition for design.” — Charles Eames</i></p>
          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <p>As I did not have access to any user data or research on Poe’s current design, I conducted extensive user 
            interviews and aimed to maintain the app's overall essence as much as possible. Upon conducting user interviews,
             I identified 3 distinct personas among Poe users to gain a deeper understanding of their needs and values.</p>
             
             
             <p>
            <b>- The Explorer:</b>  The Explorer loves to ask “what if” to explore the most creative use cases and capabilities of the AI bots.
            <i>Occasional visits. Wide range of topics/ tasks. Values: Entertainment, Model Accuracy, Social Aspect.</i>
  <br></br><b>- The Knowledge Lover:</b> The Knowledge Lover uses Poe to learn about a specific topic and enjoys reading good conversations on the feed.
  <i>Regular visits. Mainly factual topics. Values: Model Accuracy, Social Aspect.</i>
    
  <br></br><b>- The Professional:</b> The Professional aims to complete actual tasks (likely at school or work) with the assistance of AI chatbots.
  <i>Regular visits. Academic or professional topics/ tasks. Values: Model Accuracy, Low Latency.</i>
   
            </p>
            <h3>Interview Insights: Pain Points</h3>
            <div><br></br><img src="/Assets/poe-pain-points.png" alt="logo" class="project-img reveal "
            /></div>
            <p>I identified two primary pain points experienced by Poe users during interviews: <b>adoption</b> and <b>engagement</b>.</p>
              <p><b>- Adoption:</b> A number of new users have quite a hard time grasping the value proposition of Poe intuitively. They could not immediately see the value in 
              switching between multiple chatbots or leveraging the social aspect of the app. Through a UX redesign, specifically a revised information architecture, this value proposition could be communicated more explicitly to users. </p>
              <p><b>- Engagement:</b> The current information architecture of the app feels hidden to users since many of them struggled to find and navigate to the feed of other users’ dialogues with AI. This friction 
              and the slightly chunky chat screen could be improved in the redesign to increase user engagement. </p>
              <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
              <p>One of the key steps I took was to create an information architecture for the app to have a roadmap for the 
                redesign. I identified and labeled screens where users had trouble navigating to during interviews, allowing 
                me to prioritize these areas in my redesign efforts.</p> 
                <div><img src="/Assets/poe-current-ia.png" alt="logo" class="project-img reveal"
                  /></div>  
                  <h2>The Redesign: Let’s Get To Work!</h2>
                  <h3>Objectives for the Redesign of Poe on Mobile</h3>
                  <p>- <b>Adoption</b>: To clearly communicate the value proposition of Poe - the value in (1) switching between multiple chatbots and (2) discovering use 
                   cases of generative AI collectively - through the user interface on mobile. The first step towards this includes (1) creating a top navigation bar for 
                   smoother transitions between core features and (2) providing an explicit “directory” for all chatbots, ensuring users are aware of their diverse options 
                   and able to choose chatbots that best fit their needs.</p> 
                   <p>- <b>Engagement</b>: To create a more intuitive, engaging experience for current users by (1) revamping the app’s UI, (2) reducing any friction 
                   during navigation, and (3) removing any visual clutter on the chat screen to improve the cognitive load. </p>
                   <h3>Solution Brainstorming</h3>
                       <div><img src="/Assets/poe-brainstorm.png" alt="logo" class="project-img reveal"
                         /></div>
                 <h3>Revised Information Architecture</h3>
                 <p>My UX redesign solution is shown in the revised information architecture below.</p>
                  <div><img src="/Assets/poe-revised-ia.png" alt="logo" class="project-img reveal"
                     /></div>
                    <p>- <b>Top Navigation Bar</b>: The new information architecture now features a top navigation bar, a common design
                       pattern seen in many mobile apps, which now provides users with a more consistent and accessible way to navigate 
                       the interface. The new 5 tabs are Bot Wiki, Feed, Home, Chat, and Profile — resolving the issue of hidden screens
                        of the current app and allowing users to intuitively grasp Poe’s value proposition.</p>
                   <p>- <b>Bot Wiki Tab</b>: Since many users expressed during interviews that they do not know which chatbot to talk to
                     for the best response to a specific task, the Bot Wiki tab serves as a “directory” for all chatbots on Poe.</p>
                   <p>- <b>Feed Tab</b>: The layout of the Poe feed remains mostly the same for this iteration of the project due to 
                    limited time.</p>
                   <p>- <b>Home Tab</b>: The Home tab includes CTAs to all key features of Poe.</p>
                   <p>- <b>Chat Tab</b>: The current Chat tab includes a “See what other people share” section after each response from 
                    a chatbot. Since the navigation to the Feed tab is now made very explicit, this section is removed to make the chat 
                    interface less cluttered.</p>
                   <p>- <b>A Little UI Revamp</b>: For a fresher feel of the app. </p>
