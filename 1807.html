          I swim through the pain of letting you go like an Olympic athlete,<br></br>

I trust the struggle to be my biggest accomplishment. The year<br></br>

1807 means nothing to anyone anymore. But sore eyes of the people<br></br>

here are buried deep in the nostalgia of some blindly and wholeheartedly<br></br>

happy childhood. Back when our mother tongue was said to be a gift not a<br></br>

barrier of immigration. If I got to choose at life’s gate one more time<br></br>

I think I would still love you in Vietnamese. Thương em cách mấy nắng mưa.<br></br>

These souls that long to be elsewhere, they teach me how to<br></br>

let you go like they accept this loss as a passing sunrise —<br></br>

like I must learn to leave your demons behind harder than I have loved<br></br>

all the goodness left in you. Lost love is our favorite cake at a<br></br>

hidden bakery that ran out of business years ago. On the sunny days<br></br>

under the cherry blossoms sometimes I still wonder if you still chase after<br></br>

those desserts and get sad for the potential of the person you could have<br></br>

become. The birthday wishes you never got, the truths in your heart<br></br>

you could have told, and the honest compassion you could have given<br></br>

people. My roommate said humans are always capable of change and<br></br>

that’s the beauty of salvation. This racing grief brings back the cracking sounds of<br></br>

your bones, your breaths, your agendas — I can still hear your brokenness a bit too clearly<br></br>

when I let my heart sink, just like how I remember your father’s passing on your birthday,<br></br>

your hands sweating in mine when the lights turned red, your eyes sparkling on<br></br>

the first Sunday you told me about Dante’s Inferno. I wonder if Bertrand Russell<br></br>

could still help our hearts be in pursuit of the right things, because right now<br></br>

our story is lost in all the unread poetry and unvisited mountains.<br></br>

Today I once again am swimming through this ocean of grief, but 1807 no longer<br></br>

means anything. On my way home, a whole different season has bloomed,<br></br>

as if the age of innocence lives on forever.<br></br>
